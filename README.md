Language: matlab 2014b

Goal
-------------
To analyze a voice that is before adding noise, after adding noise and after 4 different types of filters.   
This project is about using FIR, IIR, Wiener ans Wavelet filters to process speech signal in Matlab.   
Then compare the results of each filters.   

Result
-------------
The original signal waveform
